# Check before sending email
This is code for an extension to the Thunderbird email software.  
Before sending an e-mail, a pop-up window clearly displays check items such as the destination address, body text, and attached files, prompting the sender to confirm before sending the e-mail.

Please refer to Thunderbird Add-ons page for more information.
